<h1>salar de uyuni</h1>
<h2>Bolivia , South America</h2>

<h3>About</h3>
<p> Bolivia’s Salar de Uyuni is considered one of the most extreme and remarkable vistas in all of South America,
  if not Earth. Stretching more than 4,050 square miles of the Altiplano,<br/> it is the world’s largest salt flat,
  left behind by prehistoric lakes evaporated long ago. Here, a thick crust of salt extends to the horizon, covered by quilted,
  polygonal patterns of salt rising from the ground.<br/>
  At certain times of the year, nearby lakes overflow and a thin layer of water transforms the flats into a stunning reflection of the sky.<br/>
  This beautiful and otherworldly terrain serves as a lucrative extraction site for salt and lithium—the element responsible for powering laptops,
  smart phones, and electric cars.<br/> In addition to local workers who harvest these minerals,
  the landscape is home to the world's first salt hotel and populated by road-tripping tourists.<br/>
  The harsh beauty and desolateness of Salar de Uyuni can make for an incredible experience or a logistical nightmare.
