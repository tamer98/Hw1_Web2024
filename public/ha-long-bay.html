<h3>About</h3>
<p>Ha Long Bay is a beautiful natural wonder in northern Vietnam, near the Chinese border. 
  The Bay is dotted with 1,600 limestone islands and islets and covers an area of over 1,500 sq km.<br/>
  This extraordinary area was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. Most of the islands and the karst limestone pillars in the bay are uninhabited and unaffected by human activity.
  <br/>For many travellers, this place is like something right out of a movie. The fact is that Ha Long Bay features a wide range of biodiversity,
  while the surrealistic scenery has served as the magical backdrop of various scenes in numerous feature films.
